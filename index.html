      <h3>History about Cordova!!</h3>
        <br>
          <p class="p1" >CORDOVA is NOT the original name of the territory it represents. NOT even the Spanish name: CORDOBA. Its territory comprises the original barrios ("balangays" in Cebuano) of Gabi, Day-as, and Pilipul (actually, Pilipog) â€“ all of which are located in the southeastern tip of Mactan Island.
            When Ferdinand Magellan arrived in Cebu on April 17, 1521, Mactan Island did not have a singular and unitary government. It was divided into barrios called BALANGAYS like Mactan, Pusok, Pajo, Agus, Pajac, Maribago, Gun-ob, Basak, Magondong, Suba-Basbas, Kalawisan, Babag, Pilipog, Day-as, and Gabi.
            Lapu-lapu was NOT the over-all ruler of the entire Mactan Island. He established alliances with the various chieftains in the different balangays like Bali-Alho, Bugto Pasan, Sampong Baha, and Magtawnas. He was lucky to have gained their support. Collectively, they fought Magellan who invaded Lapu-lapu's MACTAN (a balangay headed by him).
            Lapu-lapu's victory in his balangay was not his alone. It was the triumph of all the chiefs of all the balangays in the Island of Mactan who helped him.
            Thus, when Miguel Lopez de Legaspi arrived in Cebu on April 27, 1565, he was not resisted by Lapu-lapu in Mactan who was no longer around. He was defied by KING DAGAMI of Gabi (now part of CORDOVA) who conducted a guerilla warfare against him.

            Through this feeding program I've seen that people in Cordova are very helpful and generous especially in times of calamities.
            In this way they showcase their love and unity for everyone for those who are in need and ofcourse helping others without basing any status.
